# FP04-groundwater
- Project Title: Groundwater trends in the United States during the 21st century. 
- Name(s) and GitHub handles of individual or team members: Aaron Jimenez (@AaronCJimeny), Aiden Hamre (@Ahamre), Thomas Ho (@thomasho123), 
and Luke Mazza (LM2025)
- Our group will collect datasets containing groundwater levels and evaluate their flucuate as a function of time.
We will also evaluate the correlation between groundwater levels and wildfire occurences/frequency. 
- In the 21st century, The United States has experienced great flucuation in groundwater levels/concentration. There has been an increasing amount of wildfires within the nation as well. 
- Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s): 
- Datasets you will use (with links, if available): Data sets we will use inlcude data from  NOAA, USGS, BLR, National Agruclutrar Statistics Survey
-- From the USGS this dataset shows the depth to water level from the surface across various colorado counties. Using the parent website datasets for other states and counties can be found. https://waterdata.usgs.gov/co/nwis/current/?type=gw&group_key=county_cd National Map view:https://cida.usgs.gov/ngwmn/index.jsp
-- From data.gov, an aggregate of different types of groundwater datasets https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?tags=groundwater
-- From the Bereau of Reclamation, a map that displays data for regions across western US https://data.usbr.gov/rise-map/

- Tools/packages youâ€™ll use (with links): 
- Planned methodology/approach
- Some challenges we currently anticipate is our data manipulation and cleansing process. It might take significant work to properly visualize and interpret our findings. A current challenge we are also facing is finding usable datasets to employ. Dataset acquisition is a foreign concept to most of us and it might take some practice to find the best datasets for our project.  
- Expected outcomes
getting a good grade 
- Any other relevant information, images/tables, references, etc.
