# FP04-groundwater
- Project Title: Groundwater trends in the United States during the 21st century. 
- Name(s) and GitHub handles of individual or team members: Aaron Jimenez (@AaronCJimeny), Aiden Hamre (@Ahamre), Thomas Ho (@thomasho123), 
and Luke Mazza (LM2025)
- Our group will collect datasets containing groundwater levels and evaluate their flucuate as a function of time.
We will also evaluate the correlation between groundwater levels and wildfire occurences/frequency. 
- In the 21st century, The United States has experienced great flucuation in groundwater levels/concentration. There has been an increasing amount of wildfires within the nation as well. 
#### Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s): 
1) Our primary objective is to analyze trends in water level data for groundwater aquifers in the United States. Databanks that we have explored extend back 20 years or more, so we have excellent long-form data with which to analyze these trends. 
2) Our research questions for this analysis include: How rapidly are waterlevels changing? Will these rates of change indicate that the aquifer will dry out in the near future (e.g. 25 years or less)? Have any aquifers dried up or become unuseable since data collection started, and if so, how many? Is there a difference in the pattern of groundwater levels between the eastern and western United States? Is there a correlation between the number or spread of wildfires in areas with low groundwater levels? Is there a significant increase in quantity and spread of wildfires in an area after groundwater levels have been reduced? 
#### Datasets you will use (with links, if available): Data sets we will use inlcude data from  NOAA, USGS, BLR, National Agruclutrar Statistics Survey
-- From the USGS this dataset shows the depth to water level from the surface across various colorado counties. Using the parent website datasets for other states and counties can be found. https://waterdata.usgs.gov/co/nwis/current/?type=gw&group_key=county_cd National Map view:https://cida.usgs.gov/ngwmn/index.jsp
Historical Groundwater Data: https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv/?referred_module=gw
-- From data.gov, an aggregate of different types of groundwater datasets https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?tags=groundwater
-- From the Bereau of Reclamation, a map that displays data for regions across western US https://data.usbr.gov/rise-map/ -- 
#### Tools/packages youâ€™ll use (with links): 
- [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib)
- [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev)
- [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy)
- [Python](https://github.com/python)
#### Planned methodology/approach:
Approach:

 1)Why is Groundwater Important? (why care)
 
Answering this question provides context as to why people should care about our research/work. Groundwater is important because it is a critical component in agriculture in the US. It is also the main source of water for certain regions in the US like Castle Rock, CO and South Metro, CO [2].  

2)What reliable data exists to monitor groundwater?(Is there sufficient reliable data to analyze)

We need to collect data to analyze and see what patterns exist as well as to inform us more confidently on what affects and is affected by groundwater.

3)What is affected by Groundwater Fluctuations? (Identify problems that can be researched or worked on)

Answering this question allows us to ground our work and research into a specific focus, like how are wildfire frequency correlated to groundwater levels. This provides clarity on the purpose of our research and the problem we are trying to find a solution towards.

4)What can be gained from groundwater monitoring? (How do we contribute to finding a solution to the problems we have identified)

Provides context again on the purpose of the research and clarifies the end goal of our research/work.

Methods:
- Github
- Anaconda/Python

#### Present or anticpated challenges  
- Some challenges we currently anticipate is our data manipulation and cleansing process. It might take significant work to properly visualize and interpret our findings. A current challenge we are also facing is finding usable datasets to employ. Dataset acquisition is a foreign concept to most of us and it might take some practice to find the best datasets for our project.  
#### Expected outcomes
- We expect to find a strong pattern of declining water levels of groundwater in the United States. 
- We expect that the decline in water levels in a region will correlate with an increased severity of wildfires in the same timeframe.
